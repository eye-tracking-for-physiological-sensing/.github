## Hi 👋

At [SCIS-SMU](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/), we are exploring novel (event-based) eye-tracking methods to better understand human psychophysiology.

Group members:
* [Prof Archan Misra](https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra)
* [A/Prof Thivya Kandappu](https://www.thivyak.info/)
* [Nuwan Bandara](https://www.nuwanbandara.com/) 

Our notable works:
* "EyeGraph: Modularity-aware Spatio Temporal Graph Clustering for Continuous Event-based Eye Tracking" at NeurIPS 2024. [Paper](), [Code](https://github.com/eye-tracking-for-physiological-sensing/eyegraph)
* "EyeTrAES: Fine-grained, Low-Latency Eye Tracking via Adaptive Event Slicing" at ACM IMWUT 2024. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18813), [Code](https://github.com/arghasen10/EyeTrAES)

We publicly release our methods to support further research. Feel free to reach us (at thivyak@smu.edu.sg) if you are interested in our works and/or willing to collaborate with us.
